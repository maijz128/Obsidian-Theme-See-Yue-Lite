ðŸŽ‰Theme can be downloaded from Obsidian community theme store now!

âœ¨Theme has been updated to version **v1.0.2**!

## About

**[Obsidian-Theme-See-Yue-Lite](https://github.com/maijz128/Obsidian-Theme-See-Yue-Lite)** is a theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which is inspired by [typora-vue-theme](https://github.com/blinkfox/typora-vue-theme) and [Blue Topaz](https://github.com/whyt-byte/Blue-Topaz_Obsidian-css/).

The file style is choosed  to be as similar with [typora-vue-theme](https://github.com/blinkfox/typora-vue-theme) as possible so that you can use these two kinds of software simultaneously and switch in a low-cost way.

## Feature

### 1. Eye Protection Color Snippet

You may think that the pure white background color in light mode is too bright to read, so I give an [./other/eye-protection-color.css](./other/eye-protection-color.css) snippet with modified gray color. You can use it after installing this theme in **light mode**.

### 2. Less is More

Only modify the most necessary styles, such as color, blockquote, header font and so on. You can get the colors in [Color-picker](#Color-picker). 

### 3. Hover on Header

Available in both editing view and reading view.

### 4. Highlight the Cursor Line

Highlight the current cursor line in editing view.

### 5. Easily Change the Accent Color

If you also try other theme color but still remain the rest style, you *ONLY* need to set the Accent Color as what you like from `Obsidian -> Settings -> Appearance -> Accent Color`.

Some accent colors I recommend :

`#e95f59` from [Drake-light in Typora](https://github.com/liangjingkanji/DrakeTyporaTheme)

![](./README.assets/drake-light.png)

`#3884ff` from [Gitbook-Azure in Typora](https://github.com/h16nning/typora-gitbook-theme)
